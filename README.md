# STEINS;GATE: Divergencies Assort English Patch

![Divergencies Assort](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/68027106/146678063-cb9c5bd8-a121-41e7-9728-6a56dc4f8b84.png)

## What is *STEINS;GATE: Divergencies Assort*?

It's a collection of three *STEINS;GATE* visual novels that initially released on Nintendo Switch on March 19th, 2019 in Japan. It contains:
* *STEINS;GATE: My Darling's Embrace*
* *STEINS;GATE: Linear Bounded Phenogram*
* *STEINS;GATE 0*

## Why are you making this?

As previously mentioned, this collection received no localization, despite all three games being individually localized. *STEINS;GATE: My Darling's Embrace* and *STEINS;GATE 0* even received digital Switch ports in English on December 10th, 2019! So I thought I'd release the full package in English myself. Which means that *STEINS;GATE: Linear Bounded Phenogram* on Switch and in English, is now a thing!

## How does this work?

To install this patch, you need a Nintendo Switch with custom firmware. You can find more information on that here:
https://switch.homebrew.guide/

You also need a copy of the game, which you can either acquire physically, or digitally:
https://store-jp.nintendo.com/list/software/70010000015243.html

Once you have all of that set up, let us see what this patch does:
* It replaces videos by their English counterparts from either the Switch or PC English releases.
* Provided they exist, it hardsubs videos using the subtitles from the *[Committee of Zero](https://sonome.dareno.me/projects/)* patches (plural, as some *STEINS;GATE: My Darling's Embrace* videos are from the original *STEINS;GATE*).
* It replaces in-game images and menu assets by their English counterparts.
* For *STEINS;GATE 0*, it also includes the [patched](https://sonome.dareno.me/projects/sg0-steam.html) images.
* It replaces the scripts by their English counterparts.
* For *STEINS;GATE 0*, it also includes the [patched](https://sonome.dareno.me/projects/sg0-steam.html) scripts, with honorifics included, for consistency with the *STEINS;GATE ELITE* copy you might already have on your Switch, and the other two games of the collection.
* It translates the system messages that are exclusive to this version of the game.

## How do I install it?

First, download the latests release [here](https://github.com/Enorovan/sgda-patch/releases). Plug the micro SD card you used to put custom firmware on your Switch into your PC, or use a File Transfer Program of your liking paired with one of the Homebrew tools, and then drag and drop the `atmosphere` folder in the archive containing the patch on your micro SD root. And that's it!

## Known issues

* Some of the RaiNet summaries in *STEINS;GATE: My Darling's Embrace* do not display properly: this is because of the page size being too small in the Japanese version, can't do much about it, however do know that they are the exact same as in the original *STEINS;GATE*.

## Report issues

* If the issue you want to report is an “overflowing text issue,” head to issue number [#1](https://github.com/Enorovan/sgda-patch/issues/1).
* If it is another kind of issue, head to issue number [#2](https://github.com/Enorovan/sgda-patch/issues/2). Be sure it is not present in the known issues before reporting.


## Future of the project

* Whenever the Committee of Zero gets around doing patches for *STEINS;GATE: My Darling's Embrace* and *STEINS;GATE: Linear Bounded Phenogram*, this patch will, of course, receive updates that will include those fixes.
