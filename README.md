# STEINS;GATE: Divergencies Assort English Patch

## What is *STEINS;GATE: Divergencies Assort*?

It's a collection of three *STEINS;GATE* visual that initially released on Nintendo Switch on March 19th, 2019 in Japan. It contains:
* *STEINS;GATE: My Darling's Embrace*
* *STEINS;GATE: Linear Bounded Phenogram*
* *STEINS;GATE 0*

## Why are you making this?

As previously mentioned, this collection received no localization, despite all three games being individually localized. *STEINS;GATE: My Darling's Embrace* and *STEINS;GATE 0* even received digital Switch ports on December 12th, 2019! So I thought I might as well localize it myself.

## How does this work?

To install this patch, you need a Nintendo Switch with custom firmware. You can find more information on that here:
https://switch.homebrew.guide/

You also need a copy of the game, which you can either acquire physically, or digitally:
https://store-jp.nintendo.com/list/software/70010000015243.html

Once you have all of that set up, let us see what this patch does:
* It replaces videos by their English counterparts from either the Switch or PC English releases.
* Provided they exist, it hardsubs videos using the subtitles from the *[Committee of Zero](https://sonome.dareno.me/projects/)* patches (plural, as some *STEINS;GATE: My Darling's Embrace* videos are from the original *STEINS;GATE*).
* It replaces in-game images and menu assets by their English counterparts.
* For *STEINS;GATE 0*, it also includes the [patched](https://sonome.dareno.me/projects/sg0-steam.html) images.
* It replaces the scripts by their English counterparts.
* For *STEINS;GATE 0*, it also includes the [patched](https://sonome.dareno.me/projects/sg0-steam.html) scripts, with honorifics included, for consistency with the *STEINS;GATE ELITE* copy you might already have on your Switch, and the other two games of the collection.
* It translates the system messages that are exclusive to this version of the game.

## How do I install it?

Plug the micro SD card you used to put custom firmware on your Switch into your PC, or use a File Transfer Program of your liking paired with one of the Homebrew tools, and then drag and drop the `atmosphere` folder in the archive containing the patch on your micro SD root. And that's it!

## Known issues

* The font isn't pretty: I can't do much about that with my current knowledge, it might change later.
* The manual isn't translated: It just doesn't exist in a translated form for any of the games and it clearly would be too much of a timesink for not much.
* The *STEINS;GATE 0* tip menu still uses the Japanese asset: I had to, as any other solution would either break the menu completely or cause weird visual inconsistencies.

## Special thanks

I would want to thank Revo, for helping me figuring out things like converting videos back and forth, and dealing with some assets archive shenanigans.
